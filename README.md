# StubBuilder

StubBuilder is a user-friendly software tool for generating stubs to be used on windows devices. It provides a simple and intuitive way to create and obsfucate code enough to bypass windows defender as of the 14th od april 2023. We must say this is for educational purposes only and any misuse is not our responsibility.

## Features
- **Live notifications and data transfer:** StubBuilder provides a unique feature that allows you to send live notifications and data transfer to your Discord webhook or Telegram API. This feature enables you to receive real-time notifications about the status and progress of the code generation process, as well as transfer data between the generated stubs and your desired endpoint.

With this feature, you can stay updated on the status of your stubs and mocks generation, making it easy to track progress and identify any issues or errors in real-time. The live notifications provide instant feedback, allowing you to take prompt action if needed, ensuring smooth and efficient code generation.

Furthermore, the data transfer capability of StubBuilder allows you to securely exchange data between the generated stubs and your designated webhook or Telegram API. This can be useful for transferring test data, logging information, or other relevant data for further analysis or processing.

By leveraging this live notifications and data transfer feature, StubBuilder enhances your testing process by providing real-time feedback and seamless data exchange, enabling you to streamline your testing workflow and ensure effective communication between your stubs and your desired endpoint.

- **Windows compatibility:** StubBuilder is specifically designed for Windows environments, making it a convenient choice for Windows-based projects.
- **Graphical user interface (GUI):** StubBuilder comes with an easy-to-use GUI that allows you to visually configure and generate stubs and mocks. This eliminates the need for complex command-line setup or configuration.
- **Code templates:** StubBuilder includes a variety of code templates for different programming languages, including C#, VB.NET, and PowerShell. This makes it easy to generate stubs and mocks in the language of your choice.
- **Intuitive configuration options:** StubBuilder provides a straightforward way to configure the behavior of the generated code, such as method signatures, return values, and exception handling. You can easily customize the generated code to match your testing scenarios.
- **Code generation preview:** StubBuilder allows you to preview the generated code before actually generating it, giving you full visibility into what the generated code will look like. This helps you ensure that the generated code meets your requirements.
- **Save and load configurations:** StubBuilder allows you to save and load configurations, so you can reuse them across different projects or share them with team members. This helps streamline your testing process and ensures consistency across your tests.
